# Personal_Projects
This repository represents the personal projects that I complete in my own interest.

**Data Survey Summarization:** 
The project is a hands-on data visualization using Power BI, guided by AlexTheAnalyst (available on YouTube). In the project, a report of survey data is drafted using visualization elements such as pie charts, histograms, line charts, cards, slicers, etc.
