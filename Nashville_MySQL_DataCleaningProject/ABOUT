Nashville data set consists of 20 columns and 56,477 rows. The dataset was retrieved from Github, and initially posted on Kaggle. 
This project is all about carrying out pre-processing steps like removing duplicates, detecting nulls, and imputation, understanding and splitting columns, 
and feature selection.
The project was completed under the guidance of AlexTheAnalyst... however, I have added some of my own work to it too. I have added the overview of the data below here.
